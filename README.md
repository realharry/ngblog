# NgBlog
> A single user blogging app in Angular

`NgBlog` is a blogging app of the developers, by the developers, for the developers.

1. `NgBlog` is not a hosted blogging platform.
1. `NgBlog` is a single user - single author blogging app.
1. `NgBlog` does not include the "author's user interface".
1. `NgBlog` needs to be deployed by the author/developer.
1. Creating a new post requires a new deployment of the app.

Despite these limitations, `NgBlog` provides other advantanges.

* Ease of deployment: `NgBlog` is a frontend-only blogging app. There is no need to set up, and maintain, a backend server. There are no complicated steps for setting up database tables and what not. You just deploy/upload it to any platform where static web pages can be hosted.
* Flexibility: `NgBlog` is open-source. You can do just about anything, if you are developer.
* Data portablility. In `NgBlog`, a post is a simple markdown file (with JSON metadata). You can easily "export" or migrate your posts to different apps.


It's really a trade-off. If you want a hosted service with a nice user interface, use Tumblr. Or, use a CMS platofrm like WordPress.
If you are a developer and want full control over your daily blogging, then `NgBlog` cab be a great app,

_Note: Since it's really frontend only, it's not really SEO-friendly. If you want SEO, you may consider adding SSR. But, again, it's a tradeoff. It'll add a complexity to the app (e.g., in terms of deployment, etc.)_
