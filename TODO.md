## To Do list

Config: Done

Pagination: Done

Support remote files/posts (e.g., S3): Works as is

PWA: Partially done


Support more than one posts per day
--> Well, actually, we will probably limit one post per day, 
    but support more than one content files per post.


SSR
sitemap
permalink


Better pagination: Currently, the metadta (post.json) of all posts are loaded/fetched regardless of pagination.

"Pinned" posts & main dashboard/gallery page?

Use auth (and remove visitor token service).

Add commenting system?


"Post module" lazy loading


Post generator (e.g., UI for generating a set of files in a post-date folder)


Image file server
